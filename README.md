# DAG
Directed Automated Gating (DAG) is an algorithm and MATLAB software tool for 2D density-based filtering of flow cytometry data, which performs sequential and hierarchical filtering to identify the cell populations that are of interest and predefined by the user. The output of DAG can be input to a data clustering algorithm such as FLOCK to further segregate cell subsets.
